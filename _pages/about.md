Hi! I'm Evan. I'm currently an undergraduate student at the University of Virginia, studying computer science and mathematics. In the past, I've worked at the [Navy Center for Applied Research in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.nrl.navy.mil/itd/aic/), where I researched topics in automated planning. I've also done some mathematical research, including one paper with [Terence Tao](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2025/06/03/decomposing-a-factorial-into-large-factors-second-version/).
